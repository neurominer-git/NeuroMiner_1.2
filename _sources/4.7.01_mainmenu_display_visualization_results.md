## Visualization results
See {numref}`fig:Display_VisualizationResults` to {numref}`fig:Display_VisPermPVals`: As described in [visualization](3.2.06_paramtemp_visualization_options), various graphs or maps are displayed if the visualization has been run and can be viewed when selecting *Visualization results* in the drop-down menu.

```{figure} Images/NM_Display_visualizationresults.png

name: fig:Display_VisualizationResults
---
Overall mean results including standard errors with matrix data. A similar image is displayed for the grand mean results.

```{figure} Images/NM_Display_visualizationresults2.png

CV-ratio of feature weights with matrix data.

Probability of feature reliability (upper left), sign-based-consistency (upper right), sign-based consistency - Z score (lower left), sign-based consistency -log10 - P value (lower right) with matrix data.

```{figure} Images/NM_Display_visPermPVals.png

Histogram of the p-values derived from permutation testing.

```{figure} Images/NM_Display_visImaging.png
---
alt: Neurominer result viewer, visualization results
name: fig:NM_Display_VisImaging
---
Mean results with imaging data. Example of the depiction of the mean feature weights with standard errors for imaging data. A similar image is displayed for all other visualization parameters (i.e., CV-ratio, probability of feature reliability, sign-based consistency).

## ROI mapper
For neuroimaging data, NM provides a functionality for mapping the result maps described above (e.g. cross-validation ratio, sign-based consistency) to regions of interest (ROI), as defined by a desired brain atlas. This can be especially useful for visually summarizing your results for a publication and ease of interpretation.

:::{note}
This functionality is only available in MATLAB R2021b or above.
:::

The ROI mapper can be accessed from the Visualization results window in the NeuroMiner Result Viewer by clicking on the blue button **ROI mapping** (see {numref}`fig:NM_Display_visImaging`). This will open a separate window, as shown in {numref}`fig:NM_roi_mapper`. The window has two sub-menus in which you can set up the parameters for a two-step procedure: first analyzing and then plotting the ROI percentages occupied by the selected results map, thresholded accordingly.

:::{note}
The *plotting menu* and *active button* will only appear once you run the analysis part (the mapping itself).
