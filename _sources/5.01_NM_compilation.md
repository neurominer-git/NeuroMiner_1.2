# Parallelization on HPC server - NeuroMiner compilation

To use NeuroMiner on a High Performance Computing (HPC) server we also provide a [compiled version](https://github.com/neurominer-git/NeuroMiner_1.2/tree/main/NM_compiled) which allows parallelization of the different steps (preprocessing, training, visualization, model application and model interpretability). We also provide example scripts for different batch systems such as [SLURM](https://github.com/neurominer-git/NeuroMiner_1.2/tree/main/NM_compiled) and [SGE](https://github.com/neurominer-git/NeuroMiner_1.2/tree/main/hpc), which you would still need to adapt to your server environment. These bash scripts are needed to specify the parameters to run the respective step. 

Furthermore, to submit certain NeuroMiner tasks as jobs you need [MATLAB runtime](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). 
Please note that you would still need MATLAB to create your NeuroMiner structure before job submission, i.e. to [load your data](input_data), [specify your parameters](define_parameter_template) and [initialize analyses](initialize_delete_analyses) and assemble your results after job completion.
