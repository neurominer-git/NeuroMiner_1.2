# ML Interpreter (MLI) results
See {numref}`fig:NM_MLI_viewer_matrix` and {numref}`fig:NM_MLI_viewer_imaging`: If the interpretation of predictions was run, the results can be viewed either by selecting ML Interpreter results from the plot drop down menu in the Results Viewer or by clicking on the blue button labeled **I** next to the classification plot (see {numref}`fig:Display_ClassPlot`). Both of these options will open the MLI Viewer.

:::{tip}
You can also select a specific subject by clicking on its point in the classification plot before clicking the blue **I** button.‚
