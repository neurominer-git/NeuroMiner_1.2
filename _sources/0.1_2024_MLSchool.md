We are excited to announce that Prof. Nikolaos Koutsouleris and his teams in Munich and London, in collaboration with the ECNP Neuroimaging Network, are organizing the **Online Machine Learning School** for Clinicians and Researchers in the field of Psychiatry and Neuroscience. The school is designed to introduce  participants to the fundamentals of machine learning, with a emphasis on applications in psychiatric neuroimaging. 

Over the past years, our highly-rated program has been successfully attended by professionsals from around the globe. This year, the **Online Machine Learning School** will be held **October 7-11, 2024**. 

Join us for an engaging and informative experience that bridges the gap between clinical practice and cutting-edge machine learning techniques. 

## Registrations now open  
We welcome participants of all levels of machine learning experience. No coding experience is required to implement the machine learning models, thanks to our user-friendly NeuroMiner toolbox. This course is specifically designed for clinician scientists, PhD students, and early career researchers.

## 2024 Program

The 2024 program comprises several specialized modules, each designed to build on the previous one, providing participants with a comprehensive learning experience tailored to their needs and experience: 

1. **Seminars & Expert Lectures:** Gain foundational knowledge and insights from leading experts in the field
2. **Hands-on NeuroMiner Tutorials:** Apply what you've learned through practical tutorials using the NeuroMiner toolbox. Tutorials are held in small groups, organized based on participants' experience levels, ensuring personalized attention and support. 
3. **Advanced Methods & Data-Specific Advice:** Enhance your skills with advanced machine learning methods and receive tailored advice for your specific data and research needs.

## Seminars & Expert Lectures - Speakers
Seminars are held in the morning of each day from October 7-10, 2024. They introduce fundamental and advanced machine learning concepts which understanding is essential for running your own analyses. The expert lectures, delivered by external speakers, aim to provide a well-rounded overview of cutting-edge research in machine learning in psychiatry and beyond. 

<!-- Speakers: ... (TO DO: ADD) -->

## Hands-on NeuroMiner Tutorials
In the five tutorial sessions, students will deepen the theoretical machine learning concepts introduced in the seminars and lectures and practice their skills through hands-on exercises using the NeuroMiner toolbox. During the exercises, you will work with real neuroimaging data. The tutor-to-student ratio will be a maximum of 2:11 to ensure room for discussions and individual questions. Tutorial groups are divided based on previous coding and machine learning experience, with content tailored accordingly. Topics include basic machine learning concepts such as cross-validation, external validation, feature dimensionality reduction, correction for site effects in neuroimaging data, external model validation, and model interpretation. The tutorial concludes with a fun Kaggle competition.

## Data Deep Dive Days
This brand-new two-day add-on course was introduced to provide individual advice especially targeted to your research question and your data. Topics covered are data-modality specific preprocessing pipelines, model evaluation, analysis design, parallelized NeuroMiner employment on high-performance clusters (HPC). The tutor-to-student ratio will be a maximum of 1:2 to ensure ample individual attention. There will also be opportunities to discuss analysis design choices with Prof. Koutsouleris.
