# Setting up NeuroMiner on macOS

When you try to run NeuroMiner on macOS Monterey you might encounter a pop up window with an warning message similar to this:

> "svmtrain321.mexmaci64" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
>
> macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
>
> 'Move to Bin' or 'Cancel'

This problem arises because macOS has additional security measures implemented and a warning will pop up for every MEX-file that is being called by NeuroMiner.
> A MEX file is a function, created in MATLAB, that calls a C/C++ program or a Fortran subroutine. A MEX function behaves just like a MATLAB script or function
>  see [MATLAB documentation](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-mex-file-functions.html)

To circumvent having to verifying each MEX-file manually, run the following in the terminal:
```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine PATH_TO_NEUROMINER
```
and then
```
sudo find PATH_TO_NEUROMINER -name \*.mexmaci64 -exec spctl --add {} \;
```
You will then be asked to enter your admin password (what you use to log into your account on your macOS computer).
