# Load training template

When a parameter template has been saved in the previous menu item, it can be loaded with this feature. This will parameterize all settings within the template of the new NM structure, and thus will allow it to be initialized in the next step. Please note that you will see a menu item warning about the cross-validation set-up. This warning is to highlight the fact that if you have different data then you need to recreate the cross-validation structure.

:::{note}
Loading parameter templates from different versions of NeuroMiner is currently unsupported.
