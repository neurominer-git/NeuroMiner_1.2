During preprocessing, this option will either output all processing steps being performed on the data using the ”detailed” setting (recommended for first time use and to check processes) or you can set it so that it only outputs the training fold that it is working on and nothing else (the ”none” setting). Setting this to ”none” will increase the speed of analysis because it will not have to print the steps to screen.
