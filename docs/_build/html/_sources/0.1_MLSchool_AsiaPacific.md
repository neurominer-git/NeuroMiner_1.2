**For the first time ever, the coveted Online Machine Learning School is going global!**

To accommodate the growing success of the school, the Orygen Youth AI and Data Science and Analytical Methods (DSAM) team are bringing the Online Machine Learning School to Asia-Pacific! Proudly sponsored by the University of Melbourne, Orygen, and PRE-EMPT. The Asia-Pacific school will boast additional expert guest speakers and tutors from the Machine Learning field. The Online Machine Learning School will be held on **September 25-29, 2023**.

To further accommodate our Asia-Pacific attendees, we offer the opportunity to learn from tutors who speak **English, Mandarin Chinese, and Vietnamese**!

**Learn**
Expert seminars on essential concepts

**Practice**
Hands-on NeuroMiner tutorials in small groups

**Apply**
Machine learning competition (in Kaggle)

## Organized by

#### FAQ

```{dropdown} When and how long is the online school?
The Online Machine Learning School will run from September 25 - 29, 2023. Lectures, seminars and tutorials will run from 9:30 - 5:00 daily
```

```{dropdown} What is the difference between the full course and the free course?
The full course includes expert lectures, seminars, and tutorials. During the tutorials in small groups knowledge of ML concepts are further deepened and an introduction to the functionalities of NeuroMiner are given. Registering for the free course lets you participate in the expert lectures and seminars only. 
```

```{dropdown} Are there any differences between the European and Asia-Pacific schools?
The European and Asia-Pacific schools each have their own panel of expert guest speakers from the Machine Learning field. However, regardless of if you are attending the European or Asia-Pacific school, you will have access to ALL lectures and seminars, as these sessions will be recorded and shared.
```


```{dropdown} What is NeuroMiner?
Neurominer is a free software developed to facilitate research into better tools for precision medicine, able to perform multiple kinds of Machine Learning analyses. Neurominer requires no coding experience.
```

```{dropdown} How do I download NeuroMiner?
Matlab R2023a is required in order to run Neurominer. A free 30-day trial can be downloaded from the MathWorks website. Neurominer can be downloaded from https://github.com/neurominer-git. Please ensure you download the latest version.
