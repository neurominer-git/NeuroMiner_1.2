# How to configure Python with Matlab for NeuroMiner on the server

Check the current Python environment in Matlab, type
```
pe = pyenv
```
in the MATLAB command window and press *enter*.

If you have a python installation on your computer it will look something like this:
```
>> pe = pyenv

pe =

  PythonEnvironment with properties:

          Version: "3.9"
       Executable: "/opt/anaconda3/bin/python"
          Library: "/opt/anaconda3/lib/libpython3.9.so"
             Home: "/opt/anaconda3"
           Status: NotLoaded
    ExecutionMode: InProcess
```

To change the python executable, type

```
pyversion(“PATH_TO_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE”)
```
in the MATLAB command window and press *enter*.

:::{note}
If you've installed the required Python packages in a conda environment, make sure to use the respective python executable.
:::

Now pe should contain

```
>> pyversion("PATH_TO_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE")
>> pe

pe =

  PythonEnvironment with properties:

          Version: "3.9"
       Executable: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm/bin/python"
          Library: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm/lib/libpython3.9.so"
             Home: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm"
           Status: NotLoaded
    ExecutionMode: InProcess
```

Next we need to change the property ExecutionMode to ‘OutOfProcess’ (see matlab documentation for more details). To do so type:
```
pyenv("ExecutionMode","OutOfProcess")
```

Now pe should have the following properties:
```
pe =

  PythonEnvironment with properties:

          Version: "3.9"
       Executable: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm/bin/python"
          Library: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm/lib/libpython3.9.so"
             Home: "/volume/data/CV_condaevns/.conda/envs/venv_nm"
           Status: NotLoaded
    ExecutionMode: OutOfProcess
```
