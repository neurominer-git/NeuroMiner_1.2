# Save NeuroMiner structure
This option allows the user to save the NeuroMiner structure (NM) as a .mat file in a folder of the user's choosing. Notably, any changes that are made to the settings of NeuroMiner during an active session are stored within the NM structure in the workspace. However, program crashes can lead to the loss of information. We recommend saving the NM structure at critical points of the analysis: 1) after data entry; 2) after structure initialization; and 3) after preprocessing or analysis. This ensures that no data is lost.
